## Milestone 2 WIP
I've been exploring the Three.js library through YouTube tutorials and official documentation. This has helped me build a foundational understanding of the library. My project involves displaying a 3D object, possibly a brain model. Initially, I considered importing a GLTF model, but I may need to create a custom model to enable precise highlighting of specific areas. This approach would give me better control over vertices and data points. Currently, I'm prioritizing the interactive elements over visual design. Once the core functionality is in place, I'll shift focus to enhancing the aesthetics. The learning curve for Three.js is steep, but I'm making progress. To see the page, I've been using Vite and "npm run dev" in the terminal.
